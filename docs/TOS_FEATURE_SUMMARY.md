# Terms of Service Feature - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

**Feature**: OAuth users must accept Terms of Service before accessing the application.

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Migration**: `20251006170954_add_terms_accepted_at`  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED TO STAGING

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### First Login with Google
```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
  ↓
Google OAuth succeeds
  ↓
Backend returns: { termsAccepted: false }
  ↓
Frontend shows Terms & Conditions page
  ↓
User clicks "Accept" → Main page ✅
User clicks "Decline" → Logged out → Must accept next time
```

### Second Login (After Accepting)
```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
  ↓
Backend returns: { termsAccepted: true }
  ↓
Frontend goes directly to main page ✅
```

---

## 🔌 New API Endpoints

### 1. Accept Terms
```
POST /api/v1/auth/terms/accept
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response: "Terms of Service accepted successfully"
```

### 2. Decline Terms
```
POST /api/v1/auth/terms/decline
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response: "Terms of Service declined. You have been logged out."
```

---

## 📊 Database Changes

**New Field**: `termsAcceptedAt` (DateTime)
- Tracks when user accepted ToS
- NULL = not accepted
- Has timestamp = accepted

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT email, termsAccepted, termsAcceptedAt 
FROM "User" 
WHERE oauthProvider = 'GOOGLE';
```

## 🎨 What Frontend Needs to Do

### 1. Update OAuth Callback
After Google OAuth, check `user.termsAccepted`:
- If `false` → Redirect to `/terms-and-conditions`
- If `true` → Redirect to `/dashboard`

### 2. Wire Up Terms & Conditions Page
You already have the page with 2 buttons. Just connect them:
- **Accept Button** → `POST /api/v1/auth/terms/accept` → Go to dashboard
- **Decline Button** → `POST /api/v1/auth/terms/decline` → Logout → Go to login

### 3. Test
- Login with Google (first time) → Should see ToS page
- Click Accept → Should go to dashboard
- Logout and login again → Should go directly to dashboard
- Try declining → Should logout and require acceptance on next login

```
FRONTEND_TOS_IMPLEMENTATION_REQUEST.md
```

It contains:
- ✅ Complete API documentation
- ✅ Full React/TypeScript code examples (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Testing checklist
- ✅ UI/UX recommendations
- ✅ Error handling patterns

**Estimated frontend implementation time**: 2-3 hours

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend (Already Tested ✅)
- ✅ OAuth response includes `termsAccepted` field
- ✅ Accept endpoint updates database correctly
- ✅ Decline endpoint logs out user (deletes sessions)
- ✅ Can't accept twice (idempotent)
- ✅ Migration applied successfully

### Frontend (Needs Testing)
- ⚠️ OAuth callback checks `termsAccepted`
- ⚠️ ToS page buttons call correct endpoints
- ⚠️ Accept flow redirects to dashboard
- ⚠️ Decline flow logs out and redirects to login
- ⚠️ Subsequent logins skip ToS page (if already accepted)

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Authentication Required**: Both endpoints require valid JWT token  
✅ **Session Invalidation**: Declining logs out user completely  
✅ **Audit Trail**: `termsAcceptedAt` tracks acceptance timestamp  
✅ **No Bypass**: OAuth response always includes status  
✅ **Idempotent**: Accepting twice doesn't cause errors  

---

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Code**: Committed (3efd499)  
✅ **Migration**: Applied locally and will auto-apply on staging/production  
✅ **Staging**: Pushed to `develop` branch  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete (2 comprehensive guides)

## 💡 Key Points

1. **Only affects OAuth users** - Regular email/password users already accepted ToS during registration
2. **One-time prompt** - After accepting, users never see it again
3. **Enforced on every login** - If declined, must accept on next login
4. **Backward compatible** - Existing OAuth users will see ToS on next login
5. **Clean logout** - Declining removes all sessions for security
